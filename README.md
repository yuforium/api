# Yuforium API
_Yuforium is a federated community platform based on Activity Pub_

Yuforium focuses on federated communities so they are no longer constrained to a single entity.  Let's make communities distributed in the same way that the Internet itself is, and make communities more like public exchange points.

## About
This API is a WIP to implement a [proposed community standard for Activity Pub](https://github.com/yuforium/activitypub-docs/blob/main/federation.md).  This project also uses the [Activity Streams validator](https://github.com/yuforium/activity-streams-validator) package and has a [separate UI project](https://github.com/yuforium/ui) written in Angular.

The Yuforium API is built on the excellent NestJS framework.
